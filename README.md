# OpenCV-microRos-ledCOntroller
Utilize OpenCV and ROS Humble to create a ROS node that communicates with an ESP32 over WiFi. This project detects hand gestures, publishing to a Micro-ROS topic to control an LEDâ€”illuminate on open hand, and turn off on a closed hand. Explore the synergy of computer vision and IoT in a compact gesture-controlled setup.
